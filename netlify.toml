# Netlify Configuration
# NOTE: This project is a Node.js backend server and CANNOT run on Netlify
# Netlify can only host static files (HTML/CSS/JS)
# 
# This configuration serves a static landing page only.
# Deploy the actual backend to Render/Railway instead.

[build]
  # No build command needed - we're serving static files only
  command = "echo 'No build needed - serving static files'"
  publish = "public"

# Redirect all non-static routes to external server
# Update this URL after deploying to Render
